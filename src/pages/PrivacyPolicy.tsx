                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 29, 2025
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Privacy Policy explains how Kamil Pułka ("I", "me", "my") handles information from users ("you", "your") of the website kpulka.com (the "Website").
                    </p>

                    <h2>1. Who is responsible for your data?</h2>
                    <p>
                        I, Kamil Pułka, am the controller of your personal data. If you have any questions about this policy or your data, you can contact me at: <strong>contact@kpulka.com</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>2. What information do I collect and why?</h2>
                    <p>
                        My goal is to collect minimal data, focusing on what's necessary to improve the Website and allow you to get in touch.
                    </p>

                    <h3>a) Website Analytics & Event Tracking (Google Analytics 4)</h3>
                    <p>
                        I use Google Analytics 4 to understand how visitors interact with the Website. To protect your privacy, I use Google Consent Mode:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>If you decline consent:</strong> I receive only aggregated, anonymous "pings" (e.g., that a page was viewed). No cookies are used, and you cannot be personally identified.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>If you accept consent:</strong> Cookies are used to gather more detailed, but still anonymized, data like session duration and browser type. Your IP address is also anonymized.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In both cases, I also collect <strong>anonymous interaction data</strong> to understand which content is most engaging. This includes tracking clicks on:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Project Cards:</strong> To see which projects generate the most interest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contact Icons:</strong> To know which contact methods (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email) are most frequently used.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This tracking is event-based (e.g., "a click occurred on the GitHub icon") and is <strong>not tied to your personal identity</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legal basis for this processing is my legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) to improve the Website, and your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) where you provide it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>b) Information from Contact Links</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Website provides links to my social profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn) and a direct email (<code>mailto:</code>) link. When you use them, you interact directly with third-party services, which have their own privacy policies. This Website <strong>does not collect or store any data</strong> from these actions.
                    </p>

                    <h3>c) Remembering Your Choices (Local Storage)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Website uses your browser's <code>localStorage</code> to save your consent choice (<code>cookie_consent</code>). This is a purely functional step to avoid showing you the consent banner on every visit.
                    </p>

                    <h2>3. Who has access to your data?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your analytics data is processed by Google Ireland Limited. This data may be transferred to servers in the United States. Google uses Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure your data is protected.
                    </p>

                    <h2>4. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
                    <p>
                        You have rights over your data under GDPR, including:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The right to <strong>access</strong>, <strong>correct</strong>, or <strong>delete</strong> your information.</li>
                        <li>The right to <strong>object to</strong> or <strong>restrict</strong> processing.</li>
                        <li>The right to <strong>withdraw consent</strong> at any time.</li>
                        <li>The right to <strong>lodge a complaint</strong> with a supervisory authority (like Poland's UODO).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To exercise these rights, please contact me at the email address in Section 1.
                    </p>

                    <h2>5. Updates to this Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        I reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <Footer />
        </motion.div>
