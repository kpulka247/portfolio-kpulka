              I’m a passionate web developer from Poland who loves building
              modern web applications, experimenting with new technologies and
              creating clean, user-friendly designs. My journey started with
              simple websites, browser extensions, and now I’m diving deep into
              frameworks, 3D graphics, and automation.

              Outside of coding I enjoy computer games, both story-driven and
              competitive. I also like being active outdoors, from cycling to
              snowboarding. Coding itself feels a bit like gaming, solving
              challenges, leveling up skills, and building things I’m proud of.
